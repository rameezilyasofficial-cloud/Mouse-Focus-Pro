Hey everyone! 👋

Whenever I do screen recordings or present a project, I always run into the same annoying problem: the default Windows cursor just gets lost in the clutter, especially on a busy screen or when showing code.

I looked for tools to highlight my mouse, but most were either outdated, clunky, or ridiculously expensive for a simple feature. So, I decided to build my own C# desktop utility called Mouse Focus Pro.

Here is what it does:

🎯 Spotlight Effect: Dims the rest of your screen and creates a clean focus area around your cursor.

⚡ Lightweight: Doesn't eat up your RAM while you are running heavy apps or presenting.

🎛️ Customizable: Quickly toggle it on and off right when you need it.

🔲 Dual Shapes: It supports both Circular and Rectangular spotlights (Its my main innovation).

It’s completely ready to go, and I'd love for people who do a lot of presenting, teaching, or video tutorials to try it out.

I’d love to hear your feedback or any feature requests!
